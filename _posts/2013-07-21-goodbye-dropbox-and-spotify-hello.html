<div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I already pay $20 a month for two Spotify accounts (one for me and my wife) and now my dropbox is getting full. &nbsp;Instead of dishing out the $30 a month I decided to check out other options first. &nbsp;I came across <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5993596/how-to-set-up-your-own-private-cloud-storage-service-in-five-minutes-with-owncloud" target="_blank">this</a> article at lifehacker.com which sparked my attention. &nbsp;I did some more digging around and read quite a bit about <a href="http://owncloud.org/" target="_blank">ownCloud</a> that sounded right up my alley other than the fact that its written in php... boooooo.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I also, had been previously looking into getting a VPS but could never think of a good enough use for one to justify the cost. &nbsp;<a href="http://backupsy.com/">Backupsy.com</a> is a VPS configured for higher storage options (base level is 250GB) AND you can get it for $5 a month. &nbsp;For me this sounded like a couple of hours of work for a $25 a month savings and WAY more customization and options.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Visit <a href="http://backupsy.com/">backupsy.com</a> and sign up for their 250GB storage, 512mb ram 1,000GB bandwidth plan using coupon code "BIGDADDY" to get all this for $5 a month (50% off). &nbsp;I opted for the automatic OS install but apparently their automatic OS install wasn't working correctly so I installed the OS myself (Ubuntu 12.04).</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Once all this is finished, log into the box using the web console. &nbsp;I had to use firefox because the Java applet needed to do this doesn't work in chrome. &nbsp;Log in as the user you created during set up and install an ssh server with "sudo apt-get install openssh-server". &nbsp;You might want to read up on <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring" target="_blank">securing an ssh server</a>, and configure at least disabling root login via ssh.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Next lets get lamp, php and ownCloud installed following the instructions <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-setup-owncloud-5-on-ubuntu-12-10" target="_blank">here</a>. &nbsp;When you're done you should have a working ownCloud install and an admin user set up.</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I wanted to be able to sync my current ~/Dropbox folder, and also upload all of my digital music without syncing the music back to my computer. &nbsp;Luckily ownCloud supports the option to only sync specific folders with remote ones.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Install the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/"><span id="goog_918835802"></span>ownCloud sync client<span id="goog_918835803"></span></a>, and create a folder that you want to sync, I created an ownCloud folder in my home folder. &nbsp;And instead of syncing data with the remote root folder, choose and create a new remote folder to sync with. &nbsp;If you sync with the remote root folder everything will sync (music, photos) and you will only be able to create one sync.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You also might want to check out the <a href="http://apps.owncloud.com/" target="_blank">ownCloud apps</a> that are available to use. &nbsp;I will probably end up creating an account for my wife on my ownCloud and installing the <a href="http://apps.owncloud.com/content/show.php/Internal+Messages?content=154784" target="_blank">internal messages app</a> for us to use. &nbsp;And giving her an account will allow her to have her own storage and music service as well.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I've copied my entire dropbox folder into my ownCloud folder and I'm waiting for that to sync. &nbsp;After that I'll begin uploading my music and testing out the streaming both to my laptop and my android. &nbsp;As long as this all works out ok I'll be dropping both Spotify and my dropbox account for this. &nbsp;Next I'll also be looking into enabling SSL and maybe developing my own addons / apps.</span></div>
