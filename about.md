My name is Nick Franken and I am a Web Software Developer at [LI-COR](https://www.licor.com/) in Lincoln, NE (former Lead Software Engineer at [Firespring](http://www.firespring.com/)).  I enjoy working with Ruby On Rails applications, Linux server configurations (mostly Amazon AWS), front-end technologies (AngularJS, BackboneJS, etc), cross platform applications using Apache Cordova and many other things.  ...Also IPA enthusiast.

<h2>Purpose</h2>

I am very fortunate that my full-time job is also my hobby.  I spend a good chunk of my free time exploring new technologies and frameworks, writing proof-of-concepts and personal projects.  I figured I should start documenting some of this, and hopefully some of it will be usefull to someone else.
