I've had my eye on the [crystal programming language](http://crystal-lang.org/) for a several months now, and I for one, am pretty excited about it.  It's compiler is now bootstrapped and its [benchmarks](https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks) performances are impressive.  Yeah I know, benchmark scores don't matter.  I would suggest watching the video on the project's [Bountysource page](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/crystal-lang) for a more in-depth look into the language itself.  Here I plan on playing around mostly with the [Amethyst framework](https://github.com/Codcore/Amethyst).

Before we get started, I just want to throw this out there.  I'm double fisting New Belgium Ranger and a Mikes Harder Strawberry Lemonade because thats how I roll.

There is already a decent collection of frameworks and libraries over at [Awesome Crystal](https://github.com/veelenga/awesome-crystal).  Database drivers, a [CSFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) wrapper, 3rd party api libraries, etc, and amongst those is Amethyst.

I'm assuming you already have Crystal installed, if not head over to their [installation page](http://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/index.html) follow the instructions per your platform.  I'm using Crystal 0.13.0.
